Hello.
Oh, you look like an adventurer.
Greetings, traveller!
Looking to buy?
Welcome!
New face, don't see those around here often.
I'll be right there!
Oh, boy. Another hero.
Have we met before?
Gods be praised.
Well, look who the cat dragged in.
You look familiar, do I know you?
Weather's been great today.
What are you doing out in the rain?
Good thing, the rain. Crops needed it.
Weather's nice, isn't it?
You here for food or tools?
Well, well, well.
It's Monday, isn't it?
*grumble*
Good morning!
Afternoon.
Welcome to my shop.
Wow. Hi.
I didn't know a circus was coming to town.
Have you talked to any of the others in town?
What brings you in town?
